93.1,"Cummins to Shami, OUT",W,"it doesn't matter. Digs it in short, and it rears towards the top of Shami's helmet. All he can do is get his hands up in a desperate attempt to fend it away, and gloves the loopiest, simplest catch to short leg",Short,Leg Stump
92.6,"Starc to Bumrah, FOUR runs",4,"full, slanting away from off stump, and that's well played by Bumrah. Not off the very middle of the bat, but close enough, as he gets a big stride forward - and that's the key - and slices this drive through point",Full,Outside Off
92.5,"Starc to Bumrah, no run",â€¢,"fullish, a little wider, left alone",Full,Outside Off
92.4,"Starc to Bumrah, no run",â€¢,"length ball zipping away outside off, has a poke at it and misses",Good,Outside Off
92.3,"Starc to Bumrah, no run",â€¢,"length ball slanting away from off stump, left alone",Good,Off Stump
92.2,"Starc to Yadav, OUT",W,"full on middle stump, and Umesh goes for the big slog but his weight is falling backwards as he plays it, and he slices it high in the air, behind the bowler, and mid-on runs across and takes a very well-judged catch",Full,Middle Stump
92.1,"Starc to Yadav, no run",â€¢,"full at the stumps. Looks to work it away leg side, but closes his bat face a touch early and squeezes it into the off side off the leading edge",Full,Off Stump
91.6,"Cummins to Yadav, 1 run",1,"full now, on off stump, and Umesh shows it as straight a bat as possible to squeeze a single into the covers. Just the outcome he'd have wanted",Full,Outside Off
91.5,"Cummins to Yadav, no run",â€¢,"ooh, big hoick. Cummins goes length now, angling into the stumps, but the ball bounces over the stumps as Umesh clears his front leg and swivels violently through the slog",Good,Leg Stump
91.4,"Cummins to Yadav, no run",â€¢,"bouncer over leg stump, ducks under",Short,Leg Stump
91.3,"Cummins to Yadav, no run",â€¢,"not the most unexpected reaction. Digs it in short again, but outside off. Backs away to try and make extra room for the big pull, but can't connect",Short,Outside Off
91.2,"Cummins to Yadav, FOUR runs",4,"shot. Latches onto the chance when Cummins bowls one full, angling into the stumps. Clears his front leg slightly and slogs it powerfully over wide mid-on",Full,Outside Off
91.1,"Cummins to Yadav, no run",â€¢,"bouncer angling in over leg stump and rising menacingly towards the head. Manages to duck under it, though not too far under",Short,Leg Stump
90.6,"Starc to Bumrah, no run",â€¢,"goes short now, slanting away from off stump. Left alone",Short,Off Stump
90.5,"Starc to Bumrah, no run",â€¢,"back of a length, a bit of bounce, slanting across to middle or middle and off. Squared up completely, but manages to keep his defensive push down into the covers",Good,Outside Off
90.4,"Starc to Bumrah, no run",â€¢,"fullish on off stump, defended to short extra-cover",Full,Outside Off
90.3,"Starc to Saha, OUT",W,"gone, that was one of those dismissals where you get a loose shot but kind of understand why the batsman played it. Didn't play it very well, though. Smart bowling from Starc, slants out a full, wide tempter, and Saha throws his hands at it, looking to drive through the covers. All he manages is an edge through to Paine. With the bounce on this pitch, the angled bat is an invitation for trouble. Could have maybe gone harder so the edge would fly over the cordon",Full,Outside Off
90.2,"Starc to Yadav, 1 leg bye",1lb,"shortish, at the hip, jumps to try and get on top of the bounce and work it square, ends up popping it briefly in the air,  but safely, into the backward square leg region",Short,Leg Stump
90.1,"Starc to Yadav, no run",â€¢,"full on middle and off, clears his front leg and drives firmly back to the bowler",Full,Off Stump
89.6,"Cummins to Yadav, 1 run",1,"ooh, not the greatest footwork. Full, angling into middle and leg and straightening a touch. Jabs at it without getting either of his feet across, and squirts a thick edge down to third man",Full,Middle Stump
89.5,"Cummins to Yadav, no run",â€¢,"back of a length close to off stump, hops to ride the bounce and defend to backward point",Good,Outside Off
89.4,"Cummins to Yadav, no run",â€¢,"what a ball to greet the new man. Angling into off stump, fullish length, jagging away sharply to beat the outside edge as Umesh jabs at it from the crease",Full,Off Stump
89.3,"Cummins to Ashwin, OUT",W,"edged, and Cummins finds a hole in Ashwin's technique. Great bowling, tests him with a fuller length outside off, and he doesn't get forward at all. Just pushes at it with hard hands, and the ball straightens to take his edge through to Tim Paine. It's the first outside-edge dismissal of the innings",Full,Outside Off
89.2,"Cummins to Ashwin, no run",â€¢,"length ball straightening towards off stump. Gets his weight forward into a push towards point. He's looking for one, but it's too close to the fielder to allow it",Good,Outside Off
89.1,"Cummins to Ashwin, no run",â€¢,"bouncer to start, rising steeply over off stump. Sways his upper body away from the line and evades it well",Short,Off Stump
88.6,"Hazlewood to Saha, no run",â€¢,"back of a length outside off, left alone, and that is... stumps, yes.",Good,Outside Off
88.5,"Hazlewood to Saha, no run",â€¢,"good leave again, not too far outside off but just short enough for Saha to trust the bounce",Short,Outside Off
88.4,"Hazlewood to Saha, FOUR runs",4,"full outside off, and that's a lovely shot from Saha, gets his weight forward even though his foot doesn't go that far. Gets his head more or less over the ball, and frees his arms to drive smoothly through cover point",Full,Outside Off
88.3,"Hazlewood to Saha, no run",â€¢,"length ball on off stump, a little fuller than the previous one. Defended into the on side, bottom hand dropping off the handle",Full,Off Stump
88.2,"Hazlewood to Saha, no run",â€¢,"ooh, tight leave, but I think he left it on length. In which case it's a very good leave. Length ball, nipping in and not missing off stump by much at all, in terms of line, but it misses by about a foot in terms of height",Good,Off Stump
88.1,"Hazlewood to Saha, no run",â€¢,"length ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler",Good,Off Stump
87.6,"Cummins to Ashwin, no run",â€¢,"back of a length, again it nips back to hit thigh pad, catching Ashwin mid-shuffle. Tried to jam his bat down quickly but couldn't bring it down quickly enough",Good,Leg Stump
87.5,"Cummins to Ashwin, no run",â€¢,"length ball angling in towards off stump, a bit of extra bounce. Nips past the inside edge of his hurried defensive jab, or maybe inside edge onto pad",Good,Off Stump
87.4,"Cummins to Ashwin, 2 leg byes",2lb,"fullish, angling down leg, tickled down to the right of fine leg. May have been just pad",Full,Leg Stump
87.3,"Cummins to Ashwin, FOUR runs",4,"short, gets up above Ashwin's left shoulder, and he takes on the hook. Doesn't control it perfectly, but times it well enough to find the gap, just out of reach of long leg running frantically to his right",Short,Leg Stump
87.2,"Cummins to Ashwin, no run",â€¢,"length ball on off stump, gets his front leg smartly out of the way and blocks it back to the bowler with a straight bat",Good,Off Stump
87.1,"Cummins to Ashwin, no run",â€¢,"full outside off, gets forward for the push drive to short extra",Full,Outside Off
86.6,"Hazlewood to Saha, no run",â€¢,"back of a length, straightens towards off stump. Manages to keep it down towards gully despite getting into an uncomfortable position while defending, dropping his bottom hand hurriedly. He plays almost all his shots from the same initial position, a firm half-forward press",Good,Outside Off
86.5,"Hazlewood to Saha, no run",â€¢,"length ball on off stump, a bit of extra bounce. Saha plays that very well, raising himself on his toes to get on top of it and defend close to his body, dropping the ball right by his feet",Good,Off Stump
86.5,"Hazlewood to Saha, (no ball) 2 runs",3nb,"length ball close to off stump, gets forward, head on top of the ball, and opens his bat face to steer it wide of gully",Good,Outside Off
86.4,"Hazlewood to Ashwin, 3 runs",3,"shot. Full, angling into middle stump, just shows it the full face and punches between the stumps at the other end and mid-on",Full,Middle Stump
86.3,"Hazlewood to Saha, 1 run",1,"back of a length, Hazlewood strays too straight again. Worked off the hip to long leg",Good,Off Stump
86.2,"Hazlewood to Saha, no run",â€¢,"length ball, nips in towards the thigh pad. Rides the bounce well and clips it down in front of short leg",Good,Leg Stump

85.6,"Cummins to Saha, no run",â€¢,"back of a length, nips in sharply with extra bounce. Looks to hop and ride the bounce to defend, and the ball zips past his inside edge and hits thigh pad",Good,Leg Stump
85.5,"Cummins to Saha, no run",â€¢,"full outside off. Looks to drive away from his body, and plays it straighter than intended, off the inside half of the bat to short extra-cover",Full,Outside Off
85.4,"Cummins to Ashwin, 1 run",1,"back of a length close to off stump, smartly played. Lets it come on, and pushes to the right of point. Met that right under his eye",Good,Outside Off
85.3,"Cummins to Ashwin, no run",â€¢,"length ball on off stump, punched with the swing to short extra-cover",Good,Outside Off
85.2,"Cummins to Ashwin, 2 runs",2,"full on off stump, not much of a stride forward from Ashwin. There's some outswing, and he looks to drive through mid-off and ends up edging thickly to the right of gully",Full,Outside Off
85.1,"Cummins to Ashwin, no run",â€¢,"length ball on off stump, straightening just a touch. Defended back to the bowler off the front foot",Good,Off Stump
84.6,"Starc to Saha, no run",â€¢,"142kph and squares him up. Short of a length and into middle stump, then it pitches and goes away as Saha looks to defend for a leg stump line",Good,Middle Stump
84.5,"Starc to Saha, 2 runs",2,"good length and into leg stump, squeezed past short leg with a closed face",Good,Leg Stump
84.4,"Starc to Ashwin, 1 run",1,top edge is short of fine leg. Short and at the stomach. Takes the pull on and is not in full control as it gets big on him,Full,Leg Stump
84.3,"Starc to Ashwin, 2 runs",2,nicely played. Full wobbly delivery at off stump at 145kph. Offers the full face and drives it past the non-striker,Full,Off Stump
84.2,"Starc to Ashwin, no run",â€¢,short and pushed wide outside off. 141kph. Looks to cut hard and misses,Short,Outside Off
84.1,"Starc to Ashwin, no run",â€¢,"full inswinger, starts at leg stump and keeps sliding on as he looks to flick",Full,Leg Stump
83.6,"Hazlewood to Saha, no run",â€¢,"good length and in at middle stump, gets forward and low to defend. Rapped on the glove, it appears",Good,Middle Stump
83.5,"Hazlewood to Saha, no run",â€¢,"good length at off stump, defended to slip off the back foot",Good,Outside Off
83.4,"Hazlewood to Saha, no run",â€¢,"left on height. No visibility issues if Saha meant this leave. Close. Good length, slammed into the corridor, nipping back in and sailing over off stump",Good,Outside Off
83.3,"Hazlewood to Ashwin, 1 run",1,"full and just outside off, punched to mid-off's left off the front foot",Full,Outside Off
83.2,"Hazlewood to Vihari, OUT",W,"that looks dead in front! No vigour at all in terms of a review from Vihari this time. Good length ball, sliding straight on at an off stump line. Vihari brings down an angled bat and is beaten on the inside edge by a long way. It hits his back leg in front of off. Once again, a very odd shot. I wonder if visibility has anything to do with this. Whether it does or not, it's Australia's premier fast bowlers doing the job even late in the day. What a wonderful day they've had, pure quality",Good,Off Stump
83.1,"Hazlewood to Vihari, FOUR runs",4,"oh that's a good-looking drive. Full outswinger outside off, gets low, on his back knee, and drills it through the covers",Full,Outside Off
82.6,"Starc to Saha, no run",â€¢,"short of a length across the corridor, left alone",Good,Outside Off
82.5,"Starc to Saha, no run",â€¢,"good length and in the corridor, watches it through as he lets it go",Good,Outside Off

82.3,"Starc to Saha, no run",â€¢,"full inswinger in the corridor, driven firmly to point",Full,Outside Off
82.2,"Starc to Vihari, 1 leg bye",1lb,"appeal for lbw as Vihari falls over a flick. It isn't the most confident appeal, and it isn't given, but Australia have reviewed. That's swung and beaten him on pace, and it's umpire's call",Unknown,Unknown
82.1,"Starc to Vihari, no run",â€¢,"back of a length, swinging down leg, looks to glance but can't connect",Good,Leg Stump

80.5,"Starc to Saha, no run",â€¢,"good length and at the stumps, defended on the front foot",Good,Unknown
80.4,"Starc to Rahane, OUT",W,"gone, that looked plumb! Was he beaten for pace there? It's given, and Rahane was walking away, but Vihari calls him back and asks him to review. Full, maybe swinging back a touch. Rahane is stuck on the crease, feet going nowhere, and he jams his bat down in a slicing motion to keep it out as it tails in late. Not too extravagantly at all. Pitching just inside the line of leg stump, swinging to hit leg stump, and India lose their review. Massive wicket, this",Full,Leg Stump
80.3,"Starc to Vihari, 3 runs",3,"shot. This is his favourite area - mid-on and midwicket. Overpitches on off stump, and he shows the full face and drives between the bowler and mid-on",Full,Off Stump
80.2,"Starc to Vihari, no run",â€¢,"fullish, angling across to off stump, no swing back. Blocked to short extra-cover",Full,Outside Off

79.5,"Green to Rahane, no run",â€¢,"length ball in the corridor, steep bounce again, left alone. Went wider on the crease to try and make Rahane play for the angle, but the length and Green's height made it easier for Rahane to leave",Good,Outside Off
79.4,"Green to Rahane, no run",â€¢,"digs it in short close to off stump. Leaves the batsman after pitching, and Rahane drops his gloves and leaves it alone",Short,Off Stump
79.3,"Green to Vihari, 1 run",1,"back of a length close to off stump, gets right on top of the bounce, dabs gently to the left of short extra, and goes yeahyeahyeahyeah early and loud",Good,Off Stump
79.2,"Green to Vihari, no run",â€¢,"fuller now, angling into off stump, gets forward to block it back to the bowler",Full,Off Stump
79.1,"Green to Vihari, no run",â€¢,"nice. Excellent line, nipping in from not too far outside off, but Vihari trusts the bounce and leaves on length. Bounced pretty much over the top of off stump",Good,Outside Off
78.6,"Lyon to Rahane, no run",â€¢,"dips onto a better length outside off, plus Rahane is shorter, so he defends respectfully back to the bowler",Full,Outside Off
78.5,"Lyon to Vihari, 3 runs",3,"shot. Excellent stride forward to pounce on some marginal overpitching, and drives into the wide open spaces in the covers, below the feet of the jumping silly point fielder",Good,Outside Off
78.4,"Lyon to Vihari, no run",â€¢,"length ball, drawing Vihari forward with flight and turning into the stumps with bounce. Clipped neatly into the on side",Good,Unknown
78.3,"Lyon to Vihari, no run",â€¢,"now he flights one higher and wider outside off, with lots of overspin. Left alone",Unknown,Outside Off
78.2,"Lyon to Vihari, no run",â€¢,"flatter one, turns from close to off stump. Just lets it spin and hit his pad on the back foot. Was turning down leg",Good,Off Stump
78.1,"Lyon to Rahane, 1 run",1,"length ball spinning in towards leg stump, worked away through square leg",Good,Leg Stump
77.6,"Green to Vihari, no run",â€¢,"ooh, another edge fails to carry. No question of soft hands here. Third slip is in place, and Vihari, new to the crease, isn't fully forward to drive this well pitched-up ball in the corridor. Straightens on him, and he goes pretty hard at the drive, but the ball goes low towards third slip and bounces short of the fielder, Labuschagne",Full,Outside Off
77.5,"Green to Vihari, no run",â€¢,"back of a length in the corridor, excellent carry through to Paine after Vihari leaves, careful that he gets his bat and gloves up above his head and away from the ball's path",Good,Outside Off
77.4,"Green to Vihari, no run",â€¢,"a little fuller, a little wider, left alone",Full,Outside Off
77.3,"Green to Vihari, no run",â€¢,"beauty. Draws Vihari forward with the length in the corridor, and gets it to straighten past the outside edge of his defensive bat",Good,Outside Off

77.1,"Green to Vihari, no run",â€¢,"bouncer to start, outside off, easily evaded",Short,Outside Off
76.6,"Lyon to Rahane, OUT",W,"full, flighted ball on off stump, and a mix-up ends this promising stand. Yikes. Rahane gets forward to play the checked drive, well within range of the fielder at mid-off, who's hurtling forward at speed. Rahane takes a couple of steps out, Kohli responds, then Rahane sends him back, by which time he's already halfway down the pitch and in no position to get back. What a moment, ends a brilliantly controlled knock from Kohli, and brings the new batsman in with the second new ball looming",Full,Off Stump
76.5,"Lyon to Kohli, 1 run",1,"tossed up on leg stump, gets nicely forward to work it along the floor to deep midwicket",Full,Leg Stump
76.4,"Lyon to Rahane, 1 run",1,"nice judgment of length. Spinning in towards off stump, goes right back to tuck it to the left of backward square leg",Good,Off Stump

75.4,"Cummins to Rahane, SIX runs",6,"tests him with the short ball, and that's not fully controlled, but Rahane manages to put it in the gap to the left of long leg. Difficult ball, rising over his back shoulder, but he sees it early and is into the hook quickly. Meets it in front of his body, but can't control the height of it. Carries all the way over the rope, so he won't mind. Wasn't off the edge - met it with his bat pointing up",Full,Outside Off

73.3,"Cummins to Rahane, no run",â€¢,"ooh, edge doesn't carry. It's happened a few times today. Combination of soft hands from Rahane and the slowness of the pitch.

7.4,"Hazlewood to Pujara, (no ball) 2 runs",3nb,"outside edge doesn't carry. Played right under his eyes and close to the body, with soft hands. It's the perfect delivery. Good length, slanted in and landing on the seam. It's headed for middle based on the initial line but straightens off the pitch and takes the outside edge. Third slip was lunging forward and to his left to try and get to that",Good,Outside Off

3.6,"Hazlewood to Pujara, no run",â€¢,"past the outside edge. Still tentative, is Pujara. Short of a length and into the corridor. Hangs his bat inside the line of this and it straightens just a touch to beat him",Good,Outside Off
3.5,"Hazlewood to Agarwal, 3 runs",3,"good length and angling into off stump. Leans in and and loses his grip on the bat a touch, but gets the weight through this cover drive.

0.4,"Starc to Pujara, 1 run",1,"just short of first slip! Starc's inswinger - even the lack of it - is already playing on their minds. Pujara pushes at this length ball going across him.

0.3,"Starc to Pujara, no run",â€¢,"good length, bit of shape in at middle stump. Solidly defended down the pitch",Good,Middle Stump
0.2,"Starc to Shaw, OUT",W,"inside edge and bowled! There are two problems Shaw is contending with recently - jabbing away from the body and the ball that comes in. This is a combination of both. It's an inswinger from a good length, just a touch wide of the corridor. He's looking to drive on the rise and it's for the initial line. Gap between bat and front leg and half a stride. Not a great looking shot and it'll feel like a long walk back for him. For Starc - just another day with the pink ball. Fantastic start",Good,Outside Off
