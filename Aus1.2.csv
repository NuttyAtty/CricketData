20.6,"Yadav to Burns, SIX runs",6,"tipped over by fine leg! A win for Australia, a fifty for Burns. Short ball climbing up at leg stump, shifts his weight back and across and hooks aerially.

20.3,"Yadav to Burns, no run",â€¢,"good length at leg stump, flicked to backward square",Good,Leg Stump

19.6,"Ashwin to Burns, no run",â€¢,"tossed up at middle stump, leans in and defends to short leg",Full,Middle Stump
19.5,"Ashwin to Labuschagne, OUT",W,"taken at mid-on. Ashwin still on the mark like he was in the first innings. Beautifully dipping length ball just outside off, slowing it down because Labuschagne has looked impatient. Steps out and looks to cart it over midwicket. It drops on him and then gets big. He can only sky it",Full,Outside Off
19.4,"Ashwin to Labuschagne, no run",â€¢,"short of a length and turning into the corridor, deep in the crease to chop to point",Good,Outside Off

17.3,"Ashwin to Labuschagne, no run",â€¢,"Shaw's lost the ball as he takes an evasive stance at short leg. Marnus down the pitch, beaten in flight looing to hack it into the leg side. Not sure if there was an inside edge on that. Lobbed to Shaw's left and he was looking behind initially. Couldn't spot it",Short,Leg Stump
17.2,"Ashwin to Wade, OUT",W,"oh well, India will take that. Bizarre dismissal. Down the track and Ashwin spots him coming and fires it into his feet. Clips into the on side, straight into Shaw's right leg at short leg, and the ball rolls quickly to Saha with Wade well out of his crease.

15.6,"Ashwin to Burns, no run",â€¢,"tossed up just outside off, dips on Burns a bit, forces him to clip to midwicket rather than straighter as he'd hoped",Full,Outside Off

13.6,"Ashwin to Wade, no run",â€¢,"once again that's flighted slow outside off, and Wade gets down low to sweep it hard, into the ground and then the right shoulder of the fielder at short leg. He looks in pain here... Vihari the fielder.",Short,Outside Off
