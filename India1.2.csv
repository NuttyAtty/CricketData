21.2,"Cummins to Shami, no run",â€¢,"can't get out of the way. Short ball, doesn't quite rise as much. It's headed down leg side. Shami is backing into the leg side and trying to evade. Cops that on his right forearm and the team doctor is out",Short,Leg Stump
21.1,"Cummins to Shami, no run",â€¢,ducks and swishes at the same time. It's gone past him quickly. A bouncer at a leg stump line,Short,Leg Stump
20.6,"Hazlewood to Yadav, no run",â€¢,full and dipping into off stump. Driven back to the bowler,Full,Off Stump
20.5,"Hazlewood to Yadav, FOUR runs",4,"hacks at it and gets it down to fine leg. Short ball rising outside off, gives it a heave from underneath and the top edge brings him runs",Short,Outside Off
20.4,"Hazlewood to Yadav, no run",â€¢,"good length at off stump, defended on the back foot",Good,Off Stump
20.3,"Hazlewood to Shami, 1 run",1,good length and into middle stump. Gets deep in the crease and punches to deep midwicket,Good,Middle Stump

20.1,"Hazlewood to Vihari, OUT",W,"that's five for Hazlewood! Take a bow, you absolute beast. What a spell. So persistent, near-perfect this morning. It's another trademark dismissal - draw the batsman in with the angle in at the stumps, straighten it off the surface to draw the edge. And the edges are carrying today. Vihari on the front foot, thick outside edge, and Paine lunges to his right with two hands to hold on",Unknown,Off Stump
19.6,"Cummins to Yadav, no run",â€¢,"inside edge onto pad again for Umesh. Good length outside off, reaches out in front of his body for this",Good,Outside Off
19.5,"Cummins to Vihari, 1 run",1,good length and slanted in at middle stump. Gets forward and hurriedly pokes this into the leg side for the single,Good,Middle Stump
19.4,"Cummins to Vihari, no run",â€¢,"good length on off stump, defended into the coves from the crease",Good,Off Stump
19.3,"Cummins to Vihari, no run",â€¢,stabbed to gully. Short of a length and tucking him at an off stump. Arches into the leg side to try and squeeze this through the cordon,Good,Outside Off
19.2,"Cummins to Vihari, FOUR runs",4,"handsome. Vihari gets his weight onto the back foot and on top of the bounce of this, short of a length and rising outside off. He's in position perfectly and executes a deft square cut, along the floor",Good,Outside Off
19.1,"Cummins to Vihari, no run",â€¢,"good length and just outside off, gets forward and defends to cover's left",Good,Outside Off
18.6,"Hazlewood to Yadav, no run",â€¢,"inside edge onto the pad. Decently played, in that he's got behind the line. It's a good length ball seaming into his body and he brings down an angled bat",Good,Leg Stump
18.5,"Hazlewood to Ashwin, OUT",W,"there's a sound and the umpire's heard it too. Ashwin reviews the catch behind. Good length, landing on the seam in the corridor. Jags away the tiniest bit from the surface. Ashwin is caught inside the line on the forward defence...there's nothing on Hotspot. But Snicko has the slightest murmur. Ashwin will go first ball. Wicket number 200 for Hazlewood and now he's on a hat-trick",Good,Outside Off
18.4,"Hazlewood to Saha, OUT",W,"chipped straight to midwicket! There is no stop to this carnage. What a treat to watch this guy bowl. Not his best delivery of the morning by any stretch, but everything around this delivery means Saha has gone with hard hands at a ball dipping into his leg stump. It's a good length delivery, he reaches out and looks to close the face. He's not close enough to do that and that's off the inside part of a turning bat",Good,Outside Off
18.3,"Hazlewood to Saha, no run",â€¢,"short and rising wide of the corridor, lets that go",Short,Outside Off
18.2,"Hazlewood to Saha, no run",â€¢,"good length and just outside off, solidly forward to defend",Good,Outside Off

15.6,"Cummins to Saha, no run",â€¢,"length ball, angling into middle stump and straightening away. Looks to play the angle and clip into the leg side, gets a leading edge into the covers",Good,Outside Off

15.4,"Cummins to Saha, no run",â€¢,"back of a length outside off, left alone",Good,Outside Off

15.2,"Cummins to Saha, no run",â€¢,"digs it in short, over off stump. Gets down low and sways his upper body away from the line",Short,Off Stump
15.1,"Cummins to Saha, no run",â€¢,"past the edge again. Length ball nipping away outside off. Has a drive at it, away from his body, and can't connect",Good,Outside Off

13.5,"Cummins to Saha, no run",â€¢,"back of a length, straightens towards off stump, defended into the point region",Good,Outside Off
13.4,"Cummins to Kohli, OUT",W,"now Cummins has the Kohli wicket. I think all the wickets at the other end have unsettled Kohli, and made him decide he has to take on the bowling. Fullish in a wide-ish channel outside off, and Kohli does something he didn't do at all in the first innings, attempt a cover drive against such a ball. Slices it to gully, where Green seems to have taken a clean catch low to his left, but they're checking anyway. Soft signal is out. He caught it a few inches above the turf, but the issue is whether it slipped momentarily from his grasp on his way down. There seems to be a bit of a juggle, but it's hard to tell, given he's landing in an area of shadow, so it stays with the soft signal",Full,Outside Off
13.3,"Cummins to Kohli, FOUR runs",4,"shortish in the corridor, hops and jabs it away on top of the bounce, past the right hand of the diving gully fielder",Short,Outside Off

12.6,"Hazlewood to Vihari, no run",â€¢,"back of a length in the corridor, left alone",Good,Outside Off
12.5,"Hazlewood to Rahane, OUT",W,"I said the length was more or less perfect the previous ball. This one was a few inches fuller, along the same line, and the ball straightened again to take the edge. India are effectively 68 for 5. Rahane doesn't get a stride forward, just pushes at the ball, in front of his body, and pays the price",Full,Unknown
12.4,"Hazlewood to Rahane, no run",â€¢,"phew. What a great line this is, so tight on off stump, and Rahane has no option but to play. Straightens and zips past the edge. The length is more or less perfect too",Good,Off Stump
12.3,"Hazlewood to Rahane, no run",â€¢,"length ball outside off, a bit of seam movement away, left alone",Good,Outside Off
12.2,"Hazlewood to Rahane, no run",â€¢,"length ball on off stump, defended into the covers",Good,Outside Off
12.1,"Hazlewood to Agarwal, OUT",W,"and he strikes first ball. Wow. The most Josh Hazlewood dismissal you'll see. Extra bounce from a length, and the initial angle - much like the Pujara dismissal - isn't even attacking off stump but going slightly inside the line of the stumps. Then it straightens to take the edge, with Agarwal squared up in defence",Good,Off Stump
11.6,"Cummins to Kohli, no run",â€¢,"length ball, a bit of extra bounce as it seams in towards middle stump. Clipped down towards short leg",Good,Middle Stump
11.5,"Cummins to Kohli, no run",â€¢,"back of a length in the corridor, straightens past the edge as Kohli steps back and across to defend. This is fiery stuff",Good,Outside Off

11.3,"Cummins to Kohli, no run",â€¢,"shortish, nips in from outside off, jumps up to ride the bounce and defend into the on side",Short,Outside Off
11.2,"Cummins to Pujara, OUT",W,"Cummins is bringing Australia right back into this game. Superb delivery, angling into middle and off and straightening. Pujara absolutely has to play, the length is perfect. The feet don't go anywhere, and even though he plays as close to the body as possible, it moves just enough to take his edge and no more. His bat face is ever so slightly closed, suggesting he was playing the initial angle",Good,Off Stump
11.1,"Cummins to Pujara, no run",â€¢,"length ball outside off, left alone",Good,Outside Off
10.6,"Starc to Agarwal, no run",â€¢,"phew, that's a ripper. Back of a length, and the initial line is heading towards off stump so Agarwal is forced to play. Then it nips away off the seam with extra bounce, and squares Agarwal up while beating his edge. Did very well not to follow it with his hands",Good,Off Stump
10.5,"Starc to Agarwal, no run",â€¢,"bouncer over leg stump, ducks down low, left knee on the floor, to get under it",Short,Leg Stump
10.4,"Starc to Agarwal, no run",â€¢,"short now, angling away from off stump. Jumps, thinks about having a jab at it, then pulls his bat away in a hurry",Short,Off Stump

9.5,"Cummins to Pujara, no run",â€¢,"well played. Length ball, nipping in from an off-stump line. Stays back, lets it come, and defends into the off side with his front pad not getting into the line of the movement",Good,Off Stump
9.4,"Cummins to Pujara, no run",â€¢,"short now, in the corridor, left alone",Short,Outside Off
9.3,"Cummins to Pujara, no run",â€¢,"fullish, angling into off stump, presses forward and blocks into the off side, towards wide mid-off",Full,Outside Off

9.1,"Cummins to Pujara, no run",â€¢,"back of a length, fifth-stump line, reaches out a little to jab into the point region",Good,Outside Off
8.6,"Starc to Agarwal, no run",â€¢,"fuller now, angling across into the fourth-stump corridor. Drives with a slightly angled bat, plays a little early too, and the ball hits the inside half of his bat and rolls to short extra-cover/wide mid-off/whatever you want to call that fielder",Full,Outside Off

8.1,"Starc to Agarwal, no run",â€¢,"length ball, straightens into Agarwal on a middle-and-off line, gets behind it to defend it back to the bowler",Good,Off Stump
7.6,"Cummins to Bumrah, OUT",W,"got him, Cummins has taken very little time to take out the nightwatchman. Fullish, angling into off stump and straightening. Was it the slower legcutter? Possibly. Either way, he gets Bumrah to push at it in front of his body, without much of a stride prior to that, and the ball pops back for a return catch at waist height",Full,Off Stump
7.5,"Cummins to Bumrah, no run",â€¢,"well played again. Dug in short, and Bumrah manages to keep his eye on the ball and sway his head away, the momentum making him fall towards the leg side momentarily",Short,Leg Stump
7.4,"Cummins to Bumrah, no run",â€¢,"well bowled. Shifts his line slightly wider, gets the same movement away, and Bumrah pokes away from his body and misses",Unknown,Outside Off
7.3,"Cummins to Bumrah, no run",â€¢,"length ball straightening towards off stump, and that's superbly played, looked like a proper batsman. Got right behind it, let it move, and defended right under his eyes, square on the off side",Good,Off Stump

6.2,"Starc to Agarwal, no run",â€¢,"yikes, this has been a loose start from Agarwal. A little fuller, and a fair bit wider outside off, continuing on with the angle. Not much of a front-foot stride, and a wild drive away from his body. Beaten",Full,Outside Off
6.1,"Starc to Agarwal, no run",â€¢,"lbw appeal first up, as Agarwal looks to drive down the ground and a fair bit in front of his body. A bit of inward movement after slanting across, but a thick inside edge into front pad",Unknown,Leg Stump

3.1,"Cummins to Shaw, OUT",W,"through him! A far too familiar picture for those who've followed Shaw over the last year. Good length, landing on a seam outside off, nips back in sharply as Shaw gets forward to defend.

1.6,"Cummins to Agarwal, 1 run",1,"dropped! Paine sticks out his right hand and can't hold on to an edge that's carried. Mayank pushes on the front foot as this straightens in the corridor.
