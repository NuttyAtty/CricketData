16.6,"Bumrah to Burns, OUT",W,"another lbw, looks very good for India. Burns reviews. It's a Bumrah yorker - or one that Burns has made with his stride. Middle and leg stump line. He walks across the stumps and gets locked up with the front leg across into the off side. He's hit his toe with the bat and that shows a mark on Snicko. Umpire is satsified there's no bat on it. And Burns himself seemed to know it because he consulted for a while before taking the review. The only thing that can save him now is if that ball is sliding down leg. It is not. Umpire's call. This one decidedly closer than the last one, it's just about brushing leg stump. Burns not pleased about that. His dogged innings has ended less than ten minutes before the long break. Bumrah has swung the session India's way",Yorker,Off Stump

14.1,"Bumrah to Wade, OUT",W,"appeal for lbw and given. Wade reluctantly reviews it. Looks good if it's hit him in line. He's deep in the crease, walking across off stump and is struck around the knee roll. Bumrah is around the wicket, remember. Slants it in from a length and raps him as he's moving.
