96.6,"Hazlewood to Pant, FOUR runs",4,"full, angling across to off stump, and he's creamed that to the long-off boundary! To repeat the words of Tony Greig from 20 years ago, India have won the Test match, India have won the series, and this series has been as much of a fairytale as that one. Let me describe briefly. There was no mid-off, just a straight extra-cover, and Pant brought his wrists into play to drive that full one to the left of the fielder. He kept running, Saini kept running, and I guess no one realised there was no fielder near the ball until it dribbled past the rope",Full,Outside Off
96.5,"Hazlewood to Pant, no run",â€¢,"full, wide of leg stump, looks for the one-arm sweep and misses. Good use of the negative line from Hazlewood",Full,Outside Off
96.4,"Hazlewood to Thakur, OUT",W,"now Thakur lobs one straight in the air. This one falls into square leg's hands, though. India still need 3, and they have three wickets left. Back of a length, angling into off stump, and Thakur looks to work it across the line, only manages a leading edge",Good,Off Stump
96.3,"Hazlewood to Thakur, 2 runs",2,"back of a length, angles into the pads, clips it away to long leg. The fielder didn't have too much room to cover to his left, but they sprint two anyway. Tired legs all over the field now",Good,Outside Off
96.2,"Hazlewood to Pant, 1 run",1,"six to win, goes for the glory hit. Fullish, angling into off stump, looks to slog it over midwicket, and ends up slicing it high over the backward point region. Ends up landing away from both deep point rushing in and cover running to his right. It's Pant's day",Full,Outside Off
96.1,"Hazlewood to Pant, FOUR runs",4,"short, angling down leg, and Pant swivels to pull and find the gap to the right of long leg. He falls onto his backside while doing so as well. He's played the falling scoop, now he's played the falling pull, and he's nailing everything out of the middle",Short,Middle Stump
95.6,"Lyon to Thakur, no run",â€¢,"back and across to defend a length ball spinning in from outside off, meets it right under his eyes",Good,Outside Off
95.5,"Lyon to Sundar, OUT",W,"bowled him, you might ask if he needed to play that shot. Not much of a reaction from the Australia players, though, because India only need 10. He's played well, and he misjudges the line, possibly, while trying to reverse-sweep this. A little too close for him, and perhaps there's a bottom edge too, onto the stumps",Unknown,Unknown
95.4,"Lyon to Pant, 3 runs",3,"what a shot. That's tossed up very wide of off stump, and Pant somehow gets a big stretch out and uses his bottom hand brilliantly to whack a sweep out well in front of square, making deep square leg run a long way to his right to stop it",Full,Outside Off
95.3,"Lyon to Pant, no run",â€¢,"short outside off, keeps low and sneaks under the attempted cut",Short,Outside Off
95.2,"Lyon to Sundar, 1 run",1,"shot. That's full outside off, and Sundar collapses his back knee to create extra room and play a square drive out to deep point",Full,Outside Off
95.1,"Lyon to Pant, 1 run",1,"tossed up wide of off, Pant steps out and reaches out for a sliced drive over the point region",Full,Outside Off
94.6,"Hazlewood to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"and he produces a jaffa in the middle of all this. Length ball, angling in towards off stump and straightening off the pitch. Slices across it slightly in defence, and the ball beats his outside edge",Good,Off Stump
94.5,"Hazlewood to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"full, angling into off stump, blocked back to the bowler",Full,Off Stump
94.4,"Hazlewood to Sundar, 4 leg byes",4lb,"all the luck is going India's way now. Shortish, angling into off stump, and he steps across to pull, but it keeps a little low, goes under his bat, and pops up off the thigh pad, between slip and gully",Short,Outside Off
94.3,"Hazlewood to Pant, 1 run",1,"length ball angling across to off stump, steps across and nudges it towards deep backward square leg",Good,Off Stump
94.2,"Hazlewood to Pant, 2 runs",2,"full on middle and leg, clipped away into the gap between long leg and deep backward square leg, and that's an easy two on this large outfield. This is smart cricket, and Australia are struggling to set a field to contain India now",Full,Middle Stump
94.1,"Hazlewood to Pant, 2 runs",2,"fullish, angling across to off stump, presses forward and pushes to the right of short extra-cover. They take the quick single, and get a second when the underarm flick at the keeper's end runs away for overthrows",Full,Outside Off
93.6,"Lyon to Sundar, 2 runs",2,"tossed up fuller, wide of off stump, big stretch out to get his head over the ball and drive to the left of deep cover point",Full,Outside Off
93.5,"Lyon to Sundar, 4 byes",4b,"wow, that went like a doosra, probably wholly unintentionally. Back of a length, outside off, and it's the offbreak but it's hit the outside edge of a crack and spun back the other way to miss off stump and beat the keeper",Good,Outside Off
93.4,"Lyon to Pant, 1 run",1,"full, wide of off stump, reaches out and slaps it to deep cover point",Full,Outside Off
93.3,"Lyon to Pant, FOUR runs",4,"tossed up wide of off stump, and Pant has absolutely hammered that. A big stretch out, and a powerful sweep along the ground, in front of square",Full,Outside Off
93.2,"Lyon to Pant, FOUR runs",4,"haha, that's just sensational. That's a quick length ball on off stump, and Pant has simply fallen across onto his back knee to scoop it over his shoulder and over the keeper. Outstanding. Rohan Kanhai played the falling sweep, this is the falling scoop",Good,Off Stump
93.1,"Lyon to Pant, no run",â€¢,"back of a length outside off, left alone",Good,Outside Off
92.6,"Cummins to Sundar, FOUR runs",4,"length ball on off stump, and that's either very lucky or very clever, because he's gone hard at the drive, with an open face, and half-deliberately sliced it over the slips cordon",Good,Outside Off
92.5,"Cummins to Sundar, SIX runs",6,"short, and Washington Sundar has just hooked Pat Cummins for six! That's an incredible shot, because it's up near his left shoulder, but he steps across, somehow swivels even though both his feet are off the ground, and hits it right out of the screws. Wow",Short,Off Stump
92.4,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"back of a length, slanting across to off stump, lets it come on and stabs to backward point",Good,Outside Off
92.3,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"length ball on off stump. Looks to drive on the up and it hangs in the air again, briefly, before falling short of mid-off",Good,Off Stump

92.1,"Cummins to Pant, no run",â€¢,"bouncer over leg stump, thinks about hooking but decides just in time to duck out of the way",Short,Leg Stump

91.4,"Lyon to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"full, angling into leg stump, clipped firmly back to the bowler. Wanted to play that towards mid-on",Full,Leg Stump
91.3,"Lyon to Pant, 1 run",1,"tossed up fuller now, and Pant plays a flat-bat drive to deep point",Full,Outside Off
91.2,"Lyon to Pant, no run",â€¢,"sharp turn again. Quicker, just outside off, and Pant is half-forward to defend. Zips past his outside edge",Unknown,Outside Off
91.1,"Lyon to Pant, no run",â€¢,"Pant is getting a little edgy here. Loses his shape again while going for a big hit. Tossed up slow outside off, and there's sharp turn and bounce to beat the attempted loft over long-off",Full,Outside Off
90.6,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"sharp short ball, rising steeply over Sundar's back shoulder. Thinks of pulling, decides against it and leaves it",Short,Unknown
90.5,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"short, at Sundar's ribs again. Hops to ride the bounce, looks to work it away, but can't middle it. Inside-edges into the ground by his feet",Short,Middle Stump
90.4,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"full on off stump, driven firmly to mid-off. He wants the single but he's hit it a bit too firmly for that",Full,Off Stump
90.3,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"back of a length on off stump, blocked into the covers",Good,Outside Off
90.2,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"shortish, gets up towards the ribcage, coming at Sundar from his blind spot outside leg stump. Does well to ride the bounce and keep it down into the backward square leg region",Short,Leg Stump
90.1,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"super stop from Lyon at backward point. It's short and angling away from off stump, and Sundar jumps to ride the bounce and cuts fiercely. Lyon throws himself to his right and saves four runs",Short,Outside Off
89.6,"Lyon to Pant, no run",â€¢,"shortish, close to off stump, makes some room and cuts firmly to backward point",Short,Outside Off
89.5,"Lyon to Sundar, 1 run",1,"short outside off, cut to the left of point, who's come in off the boundary for Sundar",Short,Outside Off
89.4,"Lyon to Pant, 1 run",1,"phew, he sliced that in the air but it's fallen short of deep point. Tossed up wide of off stump, and Pant loses his shape looking to hit it over mid-off. Sliced high, but falls short of Green running in from the boundary",Full,Outside Off
89.3,"Lyon to Pant, no run",â€¢,"short outside off, slapped to the man at short cover",Good,Outside Off
89.2,"Lyon to Pant, no run",â€¢,"another swing and miss. Tossed up outside off, goes for the big sweep and misses, thanks to some extra turn and bounce. Slip has to dive to hsi right to stop it from running away for byes",Full,Outside Off
89.1,"Lyon to Pant, no run",â€¢,"back of a length and very wide of off stump, left alone",Good,Outside Off
88.6,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"bouncer, climbing steeply over leg stump, and Sundar keeps his eye on it, drops to his knees, and sways his upper body away from the line",Short,Leg Stump
88.5,"Cummins to Sundar, FOUR runs",4,"full, angling across to off stump, and that's a super shot. He played this shot so well in the first innings too, and he does it again, pressing forward and leaning into a straight-bat punch to the left of mid-off. Beautiful",Full,Off Stump
88.4,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"bouncer, angling across. Keeps his eye on it and evades it, and it swings late, after it passes the batsman",Short,Unknown
88.3,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"length ball slanting across to off stump, swinging back slightly. Flicks on the bounce to that leg gully fielder",Good,Outside Off
88.2,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"ooh, Cummins draws another airy drive. Fullish, slanting across, inviting the drive away from the body. Doesn't get his weight forward and the ball hangs briefly in the air but falls short of mid-off",Full,Off Stump
88.1,"Cummins to Sundar, 2 runs",2,"shortish at the hip, tucked away through backward square leg",Short,Leg Stump
87.6,"Lyon to Pant, no run",â€¢,"this was coming. Good idea too, with the line outside off stump and the ball given some air. Brings out the reverse-sweep but can't connect on this occasion",Unknown,Outside Off
87.5,"Lyon to Sundar, 1 run",1,"tossed up outside off, and he stretches out to drive to mid-off. The fielder is deep enough to allow the single",Full,Outside Off

86.4,"Cummins to Agarwal, OUT",W,"gone, caught at short cover, Agarwal is dismissed in the pursuit of quick runs. That wasn't quite up there for the drive, but Agarwal went hard at it, possibly looking to clear the fielder at short cover. Maybe the ball stopped on him, maybe he just didn't time it how he wanted to, but in any case, Matthew Wade times his jump well and takes it over his head",Good,Outside Off
86.3,"Cummins to Agarwal, no run",â€¢,"a Cummins special produces a massive caught-behind shout, but the umpire isn't interested... Australia have reviewed here. Back of a length, straightening in the corridor with extra bounce, and Agarwal defends on the hop with an open face. There's nothing on Hotspot as the ball passes the edge, and nothing on Snicko either. Only one review remains for Australia.",Good,Outside Off
