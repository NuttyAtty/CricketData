It lobbed up to Rahane's left at slip. Early indications are that his bat hit his front shoe. And Hotspot confirms that. The spot comes before the ball is close to bat. Umpire Wilson says he's sending it back to the on-field call, so it seems the on-field umpire had given it for the catch. He then remembers that he must check for lbw.

Green looking to capitalise on the field being in again, looking for the boundary shot - the pull. He got out trying the exact thing against Ashwin in the last match. It gets big on him and comes off the high, inside part of the bat. Floats to Jadeja's right and he times his jump well to hang on. An innings of so much promise ends tamely.

2.1,"Bumrah to Burns, no run",â€¢,"appeal, appeal, massive. Struck flush on the toe. India like what they see, they're referring this. Searing yorker, catches Burns on the boot and is caught by surprise by the pace of the delivery. But the ball tracking comes back as 'umpire's call' even though the ball was clipping the leg stump. India don't lose a review. Burns breathes a huge sigh of relief.",Yorker,Leg Stump
