111.4,"Hazlewood to Siraj, OUT",W,"bowled him. Hazlewood gets his five-for. Full, at the base of leg stump, and Siraj backs away, has a big slog at it, and misses",Full,Leg Stump
111.3,"Hazlewood to Siraj, no run",â€¢,"now he steps to the off side to try and swat the short, off-stump ball towards fine leg. Second time he's tried it in two overs. The idea is right but again he fails to connect",Short,Off Stump
111.2,"Hazlewood to Siraj, no run",â€¢,"off-stump yorker, makes a lot of room and slaps it to deep point. Decides to keep the strike himself, which makes sense now.",Yorker,Outside Off
111.1,"Hazlewood to Siraj, FOUR runs",4,"shot! Gets leg-side of the bouncer and keeps his eye on it, manages to make contact with the ramp and it goes over the slips, too fine for third man to do anything about it",Short,Outside Off
110.6,"Starc to Natarajan, no run",â€¢,"another yorker, this time it tails in late and hits low down on the front pad. Appeals, but not with a lot of conviction, because it's going down leg",Yorker,Leg Stump
110.5,"Starc to Natarajan, no run",â€¢,"full now, at the stumps, and Natarajan keeps his eye on it and jams his bat down to keep it out. Inside edge into pad",Full,Leg Stump

110.3,"Starc to Natarajan, no run",â€¢,"back of a length close to off stump, backs away and tries to stab at it, can't connect",Good,Off Stump

110.1,"Starc to Natarajan, no run",â€¢,"short, rising steeply over off stump. Backs away again, has a swish at it, and misses",Short,Off Stump
109.6,"Hazlewood to Siraj, 2 runs",2,"shot. Not off the middle, but these are important runs. Makes a lot of room again, and Hazlewood goes to a fuller length on off stump. Scooped over mid-off, and they run two. Leaves Natarajan on strike for the next over, though",Full,Off Stump
109.5,"Hazlewood to Siraj, no run",â€¢,"short over off stump, backs away to the leg side and swings mightily across the line, can't connect",Short,Off Stump

109.1,"Hazlewood to Siraj, no run",â€¢,"good thinking from Siraj, steps across to the off side this time, looking to hoick the shortish off-stumpish ball towards fine leg. Can't connect, however",Short,Off Stump
108.6,"Starc to Natarajan, no run",â€¢,"greeted by a short ball first up, at his body. Backs away, almost turns his back on the ball, and offers a single-handed jab at it. Manages to keep it out and keep it down",Short,Off Stump
108.5,"Starc to Sundar, OUT",W,"gone, another excellent catch from Green at gully. Good ball from Starc, short and angling sharply into Washington. Got caught in two minds, between swaying away and trying to ramp it over gully, ended up doing the latter without a whole lot of conviction, and Green dives to his left to complete the catch. Superb innings on debut, he's brought the deficit down to 41. He's just 21, and there's so much time for him to expand on his sound batting and bowling fundamentals",Short,Outside Off
108.4,"Starc to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"ooh, a bit of late inswing as Starc fires in a middle-stump yorker. Watches it carefully and jabs it back to the bowler",Yorker,Middle Stump
108.3,"Starc to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"short ball gets up to just above chest height on off stump. Rides the bounce with both feet off the ground and defends with soft hands, right by his feet",Short,Off Stump

108.1,"Starc to Sundar, 2 runs",2,"back of a length outside off, and that's excellent from Sundar, taps it towards deep point, but doesn't hit it too hard, and calls immediately for two because the fielder has to come in a long way off the rope",Good,Outside Off
107.6,"Hazlewood to Siraj, 2 runs",2,backs away again and Hazlewood follows him with a back-of-a-length ball. Carved away over the cover region without quite middling it,Good,Outside Off
107.5,"Hazlewood to Siraj, FOUR runs",4,"wow. Assumed correctly that he'd get a short one first up, and it was a similar ball to the one that got Saini, ut Siraj has stepped away to the leg side to make himself room, and he cuts it in the air, deliberately, over the point region",Short,Outside Off
107.4,"Hazlewood to Saini, OUT",W,"gone, Hazlewood's got his man. Again that short, rising ball that isn't quite a bouncer. No option of ducking or swaying here, the ball kept following him even as he tried to stay leg-side of the ball, and climbed towards the shoulder of his bat to find the edge to second slip",Short,Outside Off
107.3,"Hazlewood to Saini, no run",â€¢,"shortish on off stump, hops up to ride the bounce and plays it close to his body, if in ungainly fashion, to ensure the ball stays down on its way to gully",Short,Outside Off

106.5,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"another bouncer, this time gets up steeply over the stumps and Washington ducks under it",Short,Unknown
106.4,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"lucky. Banged in short, and Sundar was trying to sway away from the line, but the ball didn't get up as high as he expected and hit him on the left shoulder. Then it bounces onto the pitch and rolls backwards, and doesn't miss off stump by much, but Washington looks so nonchalant as if nothing happened",Short,Off Stump
106.3,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"back of a length on off stump, lets it come to him this time and punches to mid-off",Good,Off Stump
106.2,"Cummins to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"back of a length, slanting across to off stump. Looks to punch down the ground without really moving his feet, and it straightens and hits inside edge, then onto thigh pad",Good,Off Stump
106.1,"Cummins to Saini, 1 run",1,"short, angling into the body and bouncing just above waist-high over leg stump. Saini was trying to back away and finds the ball following him. Jams his bat down and manages to squeeze it down to third man",Short,Leg Stump
105.6,"Hazlewood to Sundar, no run",â€¢,"bouncer, slanting across Sundar. He thinks about leaning back and ramping it over the slips, but pulls out of the stroke because it's bounced too high",Short,Outside Off

104.4,"Cummins to Saini, no run",â€¢,"somehow gets out of the way of another sharp bouncer. He was stepping away to the leg side but also trying to jab at the ball, and he's lucky not to have got any glove on it",Short,Leg Stump
104.3,"Cummins to Saini, no run",â€¢,"short, rising ball in the corridor, does well to leave it without leaving his bat or gloves in the way",Short,Outside Off

104.1,"Cummins to Saini, FOUR runs",4,"lucky runs for Saini, as he ducks into a bouncer from Cummins without really keeping his eye on it. His hands go up as a reflex act of self-protection, and the ball hits the shoulder of his bat and loops up over gully",Short,Outside Off
103.6,"Lyon to Sundar, SIX runs",6,"it's a no-look six! Goes down on his back knee and slog-sweeps this, but with an almost straight bat, over deep midwicket. Extraordinary shot. We've seen those from Andre Fletcher in the BBL",Unknown,Unknown

102.5,"Cummins to Saini, no run",â€¢,"a bouncer over off stump, left alone...Cummins is appealing and Australia have reviewed! Cummins and Wade are sure they heard a sound. Erm, well, think less said about that the better. There is a whole zip code between the ball, bat and glove",Short,Off Stump
